==== !Important!                 New Name                  !Important! ====
===========================================================================

The package datarecorder has since version 0.3.5 the new name
ksimus-datarecorder instead of datarecorder in prior versions. The files and
directories are renamed also. This supports a uniform naming schema for the
KSimus packages.
Because this you have to uninstall a prior version before installing the new
package.

Sorry for any circumstances!


===========================================================================
====                         How to install                            ====
===========================================================================

Use the common way to install KSimus

>  ./configure
>  make
>  make install (as root)

Some distributions requires some parameter for configure.
If you are not sure use
>  ./configure --prefix=KDEDIR --with-qt-dir=QTDIR
where KDEDIR is the directory where KDE is installed
e.g. /opt/kde2 or /usr/local/kde
QTDIR is the directory where QT is installed
e.g. /usr/lib/qt2

Install first ksimus and than the packages in any order.


If you get the error message:

> ./Makefile.am:5: EXTRA_DIST multiply defined in condition TRUE
>
>   EXTRA_DIST (User, where = 5) =
>   {
>     TRUE => ksimus-boolean.kdevprj AUTHORS COPYING ChangeLog INSTALL README
> TODO ksimus-boolean.lsm
>   }

You have to modify the Makefile.am in the base directory of the package. Please
change the line (is near the end of file)
EXTRA_DIST = admin
into
# EXTRA_DIST = admin

====            A summery of changes and new features:                 ====
===========================================================================

====  Watch View ====
The most important is the watch view with some debug possibilities including
a trace buffer and break points.

====  Package Names ====
Some users told me to unify the name of component packages. The new names are
- ksimus-boolean
- ksimus-floatingpoint
- ksimus-datarecorder
To avoid version conflicts uninstall the old packages before install the new
ones.
Some hints if you want to remove the files manually instead of make uninstall.
Following files and dirs are not used and not updated with the new packages:
Remove all files in:
$KDEDIR/lib/ksimus/
Remove the dirs:
$KDEDIR/share/doc/HTML/en/boolean
$KDEDIR/share/doc/HTML/en/datarecorder
$KDEDIR/share/doc/HTML/en/ksimusfloatingpoint

====  Command Line Options ====
There new command line options:
  --execute    starts the simulation of the given file immediatly
  --language   use the given language (for testing)

==== Data Transport Layer ====
Data transport layer redesigned. Faster execution, easier component
  implementation, no delay for external connectors and converters

==== New Components ====
New components:
- KSimus
  * Pause (pauses the simulation if input gets active)
  * Stop (stops the simulation if input gets active)
  * Close (close the document if input gets active)
- Package Boolean
  * Delay
  * Demultiplexer
  * Multiplexer
- Package DataRecorder
  * A Textrecorder (logs data to a file)
- Package FloatingPoint
  * atan2
  * sinh
  * asinh
  * cosh
  * acosh
  * tanh
  * atanh
  * random
  * delay

==== Bug Fixes ====
There are a lot of bug fixes. Some crashed KSimus, some causes an infinite loop,
some cause data lost, but most was only uncomfortable.

==== Translations ====
Remove the outdated brazilian portuguese translation from project.
Update french and german translation.

====                               FAQ                                 ====
===========================================================================

* KSimus crashs while loading additional packages.

Reason: The package interface is not compatible to the KSimus interface.

Please update KSimus and/or the package. The versions of KSimus and
packages must be the same (e.g. all 0.3.5).

The reason of the crash seems to be within the libtool library.

See also:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=127083

After patching the libtool KSimus will not crash and will also not load the
incompatible package.
