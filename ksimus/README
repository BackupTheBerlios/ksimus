====                         New Name                                  ====
===========================================================================

The packages have since version 0.3.5 the new names like
ksimus-boolean instead of boolean in prior version. The files and
directories are renamed also. This supports a uniform naming schema for the
KSimus packages.
Because this you have to uninstall a prior version before installing the new
package.

Sorry for any circumstances!

====                         How to install                            ====
===========================================================================

Use the common way to install KSimus:

>  ./configure
>  make
>  make install (as root)

Some distributions requires some parameter for configure.
If you are not sure use
>  ./configure --prefix=KDEDIR --with-qt-dir=QTDIR
where KDEDIR is the directory where KDE is installed
e.g. /opt/kde2 or /usr/local/kde
QTDIR is the directory where QT is installed
e.g. /usr/lib/qt2

Install first ksimus and than the packages in any order.

====    A summery of changes and new features in version 0.3.6:        ====
===========================================================================

====  Command Line Options ====
There is new command line option:
  --hidden    execute KSimus in hidden mode (only in combination with option 'execute')


====  Modules ====
KSimus allows the user to load modules during application startup. These module are sorted 
to the tree view and the user can use them like regular components. The user can define single 
module files as well as complete directories to search for modules.


==== External Connectors ====
External connectors may be optional know. The module creator can define an External Connector as
optional. In case of External Input Connectors there is also a definable state or value which is 
used if the connector is not connected (or hidden).
In this case the user of the module can decide to use the connector or hide it. 


==== New Data Type ====
This data type has the three states 'False', 'True' and 'Inactive'. The state 'Inactive' 
is also known as 'High Impedance'. A Tristate wire connects one or more Boolean Tristate 
connectors. 
How does it works? The combination of Boolean Tristate connectors and wire acts like a 
'wired and' circuit. One active low output causes a low state on the wire. The wire state 
is true, if the state of all connectors are inactive or true. 


==== Implicit Data Converter ====
This new feature allows you to connect a input connector to a wire with different data types,
e.g. connect a boolean input to a floatingpoint wire. 


==== New Components ====
New components:
- Package Boolean
  * Identity, Inverter
  * AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, XNOR with tristate output
  * Converter Boolean -> Boolean Tristate, Boolean Tristate -> Boolean
  * External Connector Boolean Tristate

==== Bug Fixes ====
There are a lot of bug fixes. Some crashed KSimus, some causes an infinite loop,
some cause data lost, but most was only uncomfortable.


  

===========================================================================
====    A summery of changes and new features in version 0.3.5:        ====
===========================================================================

====  Watch View ====
The most important is the watch view with some debug possibilities including
a trace buffer and break points.

====  Package Names ====
Some users told me to unify the name of component packages. The new names are
- ksimus-boolean
- ksimus-floatingpoint
- ksimus-datarecorder
To avoid version conflicts uninstall the old packages before install the new
ones.
Some hints if you want to remove the files manually instead of make uninstall.
Following files and dirs are not used and not updated with the new packages:
Remove all files in:
$KDEDIR/lib/ksimus/
Remove the dirs:
$KDEDIR/share/doc/HTML/en/boolean
$KDEDIR/share/doc/HTML/en/datarecorder
$KDEDIR/share/doc/HTML/en/ksimusfloatingpoint

====  Command Line Options ====
There new command line options:
  --execute    starts the simulation of the given file immediatly
  --language   use the given language (for testing)

==== Data Transport Layer ====
Data transport layer redesigned. Faster execution, easier component
  implementation, no delay for external connectors and converters

==== New Components ====
New components:
- KSimus
  * Pause (pauses the simulation if input gets active)
  * Stop (stops the simulation if input gets active)
  * Close (close the document if input gets active)
- Package Boolean
  * Delay
  * Demultiplexer
  * Multiplexer
- Package DataRecorder
  * A Textrecorder (logs data to a file)
- Package FloatingPoint
  * atan2
  * sinh
  * asinh
  * cosh
  * acosh
  * tanh
  * atanh
  * random
  * delay

==== Bug Fixes ====
There are a lot of bug fixes. Some crashed KSimus, some causes an infinite loop,
some cause data lost, but most was only uncomfortable.

==== Translations ====
Remove the outdated brazilian portuguese translation from project.
Update french and german translation.

====                               FAQ                                 ====
===========================================================================

* KSimus crashes while loading additional packages.

Reason: The package interface is not compatible to the KSimus interface.

Please update KSimus and/or the package. The versions of KSimus and
packages must be the same (e.g. all 0.3.5).

The reason of the crash seems to be within the libltdl library. The version 1.5
seems to be fixed. If you use this version KSimus show a messages which symbol is
missing/wrong or so.

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=127083

After patching the libtool KSimus will not crash and will also not load the
incompatible package.
