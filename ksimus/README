* KSimus crashs while loading additional packages.

Reason: The package interface is not compatible to the KSimus interface.

Please update KSimus and/or the package. The versions of KSimus and
packages must be the same (e.g. all 0.3.5).

The reason of the crash seems to be within the libtool library.

After patching the libtool KSimus will not crash and will also not load the
incompatible package.
