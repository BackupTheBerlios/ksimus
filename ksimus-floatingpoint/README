The package floatingpoint has since version 0.3.5 the new naming
ksimus-floatingpoint instead of ksimusfloatingpoint in prior version. The files and
directories are renamed also. This supports a uniform naming schema for the
KSimus packages.
Because this you have to uninstall a prior version before installing the new
package.

Sorry for any circumstances!
